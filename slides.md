# Setting the scene

- A cloud platform since 2012, known today as SAP BTP
- Multiple functions and purposes
- The go-to platform for everything beyond core products
  - Integrations
  - Extensions
  - Messaging
  - Connectivity
  - Cloud native developments
  - Services
  - ... and lots more
- Large array of offerings - "resources"
- Our first experience is via the SAP BTP Cockpit

## Takeaway

- The Cockpit is great for HUMANS ðŸ‘±

# The next level

- Hyperscaler platforms, where resources co-exist
- Cattle not pets - see [Monday morning thoughts: a cloud native smell][1]
