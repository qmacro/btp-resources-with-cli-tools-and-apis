# BTP Resources with CLI and APIs

## Description

This repository contains material related to talks on managing resources on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) with tools on the command line interface (CLI), and with APIs.

## Context

You've committed to the cloud, and started to explore BTP via the cockpit's UI. But now you want to get to the next level to understand and manage your resources efficiently, aligned with the rest of your devops workflows.

To get to that next level, you need to learn what resources there are to manage, and how to manage them with powerful tools that you can build into automated mechanisms. The command line tools and APIs are where the rubber meets the road, and you need to be in the driving seat.

If you're interested in levelling up in this space, and embracing command line tools and APIs that give you superpowers for your SAP BTP environment, this content is for you.
